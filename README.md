# Deep Learning–Based Prediction of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) After Liver Transplantation


## Overview

This repository provides a deep learning framework to predict **Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)** in patients after **Liver Transplantation (LT)**. It is based on methods described in the paper:

> **Deep Learning–Based Prediction Modeling of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events After Liver Transplantation**  
> *Abdelhameed, A., Bhangu, H., Feng, J., Li, F., Hu, X., Patel, P., Yang, L., & Tao, C. (2024)

This project aims to showcase the end-to-end pipeline:
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis  
3. Model training & evaluation  
4. Result interpretation & visualization
